# CPLEX Files
This repository contains all the CPLEX files (i.e., .mod and .dat) used in this study. 
ProjectOA.mod stands for the OPL model of the scenario where no existing stations were considered, whereas ProjectOAExisting.mod refers to the OPL model when forcing the existing stations into the solution. The DataStations.dat file describes the connection with the matiz_distancia.xlsx file that contains the parameter values needed to solve the problem (i.e., the set of stations and the matrix of the shortest distance).

# Set of points

It is also possible to access the set of points generated after treating and clustering the data by downloading the "pontos_escolhidos_k_means.csv". Points p0 to p14 correspond to the 15 points obtained and c0 to c4 refer to the points of the existing charging stations.
